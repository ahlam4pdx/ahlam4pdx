          I'm running for City Council because I envision a more equitable and
          sustainable future for Portland. Our neighborhoods and their diverse
          communities deserve livable built environments that are healthy, safe,
          and thriving. As a daughter of Somali refugees and native Portlander,
          I've witnessed the profound effects of underrepresentation in civic
          leadership and local decision-making. Together, let's reimagine a
          brighter, healthier, and safer future for Portland.

            <b>Environmental and Climate Advocacy: </b><br />My goal is to
            advocate for climate justice by prioritizing climate resiliency for
            frontline communities, recognizing the interrelation of the climate
            crisis with urban infrastructure, housing, and health disparities. I
            aim to promote equal environmental protection for all, irrespective
            of race, color, or national origin, within an intersectional
            environmentalism framework.

            <br />People and communities must be viewed as assets and as key

            immigrants, refugees, and historically left out voices. A
            community-driven process increases the flow of critical data from
            communities and community leaders to policy-makers.

            Ahlam Osman is a young Somali American who explores the
            intersectionalities of race and climate issues and believes in the
            importance of empowering communities through policy advocacy and
            building political power. Osman served on The Multnomah Youth
            Commission, the official youth policy body for both Multnomah County
            and the City of Portland, from her first year of high school to her
            first year of university.
          </p>
          <p>
            2018 to 2020, Osman was an intern with Metro under their Waste
            Prevention and Environmental Services (WPES) department, where she
            learned about the regional waste management system and the overall
            power a unique regional body like Metro acquires. Through her time
            with MYC, and Metro, and volunteering with grassroots organizations,
            she learned the cruciality of communities being informed of their
            local government systems, and for policy and decision-makers to play
            an active role in meeting communities where they are at.
          </p>
          <p>
            In her work, she aims to create platforms to address environmental
            disparities within frontline communities, including Black, brown,
            and immigrant populations. Ahlam is a student at Portland State
            studying community development. She has a passion for environmental
            justice, equitable, sustainable, and people-centered planning and
            development, and is committed to using her skill sets in
            problem-solving, community engagement, and creative thinking to
            bring equity to every facet of this work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond her environmental efforts, Ahlam is a small business owner;
            and co-founder of a new coffee shop in town, Above GRND Coffee. As
            an urbanist and multidisciplinary professional, this passion project
            shows her commitment to what she calls community-economic
            development through place-making in Portland’s local business
            landscape.

        <h2>Family History</h2>
        <div class="aboutMeP">
          <p>
            In the early 1990s, my parents fled their home in Mogadishu, with my
            6 siblings, during the country’s bloody civil war. My family spent
            four years in a refugee camp in Kenya, where conditions were cramped
            and necessities scarce. Our family survived, thanks to financial
            support from my father’s uncle who lived in Los Angeles.
          </p>
          <p>
            My uncle helped bring my family to California, but they moved to
            Portland five years later after my mother developed asthma.
            Portland, they thought, offered cleaner air – though we later
            realized it was far from pristine, especially during fire season.
            Portland has one of the worst air quality rates, and living and
            growing up in SE Portland which has higher levels of pollution and
            less tree canopy, doesn’t help.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am my parents' youngest daughter, and I have 10 siblings. I come
            from a lineage of survivors, hard-workers, and changemakers, and I
            plan to honor this legacy by continuing this line of work.
